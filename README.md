# School District Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of school district data regarding standardized test data in order to interpret overall school performance. We have been working closely with Maria to interpret the data and categorize the grades/ performance across grades 9 through 12. However, it has been brought to Maria's attention by the school board that the students_complete csv file we were working with appears to have showed tampered grades, specifically for the reading and math grades of 9th graders of Thomas High School thus implying academic dishonesty. Since we have already performed an analysis on this specific data set before, Maria has tasked us in repeating it but this time omitting the Thomas High School 9th grades reading and math scores in order to better represent the overall school district data.

When comparing the disctricts before and after the omition of the Thomas High School 9th grade students, we can observe a very miniscule difference in the data. We can see a difference of .20% between the percentage of students passing math. There is a difference of .1% of the students passing readying. The percentage overall was impacted by roughly .3%. Based off this new analysis, we can observe the small changes the omittion of data presented and see that it actually did impact the overall school district data, albeit a very small but noticeable difference.

Upon analysis of the two tables presenting the school summary before and after the removal of the Thomas High School 9th graders, we observe that:
- There is a sharp decrease in overall passing percentage, observing the drop from **90.9%** to roughly **65**
- There is a sharp decrease in the passing math percentage category, observing the drop from **93.2** to roughly **66.9**
- There is a sharp decrease in the passing reading percentage category, observing the drop from **97.3%** to roughly **69.6**
